# A Multifaceted Identity of Discovery
## Writing Portfolio By Divi Newton

### About this Project
An exploration of identity through creative nonfiction writing and self-reflection. Throughout this semester in Writing For Life, my three core projects and countless journal entries have become a sort of journal of my identity. They have built on each other, each project producing more insight and clarification for the last. Through the combination of these identity-focused pieces, I tell a story about who I am.
