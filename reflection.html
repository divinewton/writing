            <p class="essay-text">A portfolio focused on Identity is what I hope to explore at the conclusion of this class. Through the course of this semester, my core projects have become a sort of journal of identity for me. They have built on each other, each project producing more insight and clarification for the last. Through this Identity theme, I will tell a story about who I am. Titling my portfolio A Multifaceted Identity of Discovery, will enable me to truly define my identity and my projects from this course. The form of my portfolio will be a website, as I believe this will be the best way to organize my media and writing. It will allow me to separate each project, each aspect of my identity, into unique pages that can have different fonts, color palettes, and design elements to show their similarities and differences. Using header links will create a simple way to navigate through my portfolio. Overall, I believe this format and theme will showcase my core projects as a collective unit, allowing the reader to discover my identity one step at a time.</p>
