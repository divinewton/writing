            <p class="essay-text-small">Dear Reader,</p>
        </div>
        <div class="essay-section">
            <p class="essay-text">As I conclude the semester with this portfolio, I want to share the messages behind my work. Writing for Life has not only provided me with the literary tools necessary to accomplish my life goals; it has shown me what it is like to be vulnerable and personal while telling a story. When I began this semester, I was unsure where it would take me. I was uncertain about how much I was willing to put into it and how much I’d get in return. Looking back on this semester, I can see the extent of my growth and knowledge. I feel somewhat changed by this course, and it has made me more excited than ever to continue writing in the future.</p>
            <p class="essay-text">Throughout my life, I’ve always been a reasonably strong writer. I have gotten consistently positive feedback and have always seemed to know how to convey a message. What I have learned most of all this semester is how to be vulnerable and honest through my work. I’ve come to understand that sharing true feelings and deep emotions with the reader has a strong impact. This portfolio shows the growth that I've made and showcases the ways in which I’ve been able to share truths and vulnerabilities with others.</p>
            <p class="essay-text">As a computer science major at Chapman, finding creative and expressive outlets is often challenging. Being in such a technically motivated field means I frequently lack the time necessary to truly produce creativity. Writing for Life gave me the space to share what I had to say. Through our explorations of different genres and mediums of creative nonfiction, I found it increasingly easy to share my story through words. Through this course, I have produced pieces that I am beyond proud of. Hearing my classmate’s and professor’s reactions and responses to them drove me to write at a whole new level. I feel that I was able to accomplish something powerful, and I hope that in experiencing this portfolio, you will be able to learn, through my story, what it is like to be a queer, multicultural, artistic, and creative human being.</p>
            <p class="essay-text">Starting with the first core project, I wanted to challenge myself with creating a highly personal identity-driven piece. Though I knew this would be a challenge, I used the resources of literary and technical skills provided to me to make one of the pieces I’m most proud of ever writing. This piece, focusing on my sexuality, received outstanding feedback from my peer review partner. Through sharing details, explicit images, and emotional journeys, I believe I was able to convey emotions beyond the words in this piece. Through making the conscious effort to tell the story in full and to the best of my ability, I was able to create something that moved others. Through each core project, I produced more insight and clarification on who I am and the story I wanted to tell, each time learning from the last.</p>
            <p class="essay-text">Upon completion of this course, I’ve come to the realization that I want to write. I don’t yet know in what form or context, but I want to continue writing and telling my truths to an audience. As stated in my writing manifesto, one of my biggest realizations this semester was the idea that writing is truth, whether fictitious or not. Sharing truth is something that I hold dear to me, and I hope to continue on this journey into the future.</p>
            <p class="essay-text">Though I have previously thought of essays in a negative light, this course changed my perspective. Through different types of writing and reflections, I am now able to understand the meaning and importance of each aspect of writing, whether that be research, drafting, peer-review, or editing. Each of our writing journals, workshops, and reading responses gave me more insight into writing as a process. My notion of the essay has changed for the better, and for that, I credit the time and effort I put into each core project and journal entry this semester.</p>
            <p class="essay-text">As you read this portfolio, I hope you will find an authentic understanding of my journey and my story. Through this collection of memories and reflections, I hope to share a unique and interesting perspective on life and the world around us. This course has taught me so much, and these are lessons that I will take with me for the rest of my life. I thank my professor and peers for providing me with the open and loving environment I needed to thrive in. Happy reading!</p>
